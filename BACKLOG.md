# Backlog

Status as of 2026-11-01, after log 0023 (**re-scope**: the starting point is
LINZ's `topo-raster-gridded`, i.e. Topo50 itself — see R-18). IDs are stable;
reference them from commits and research-log entries. The board needs mermaid
with `kanban` support (11.4+); validated with mermaid 12.2.0.

The coloured bar on each card is mermaid's priority marker (red = very high,
orange = high, dark blue = low, pale blue = very low). It's colour-only, so
priority is also written out in the table.

**Secondary track:** `styles/accessible-v0*.json` (derived from
`topographic-v2`) remains valid work and stays gated in CI, but it is not the
product. Its research and decisions carry over to the QGIS fork.

## Items

| ID | Priority | Item | Done when | Depends on | Refs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B-01 | Very High | Decide whether to drop superseded composite PNGs from history; create GitHub repo; push | Pushed; decision logged | — | OQ-14 |
| B-02 | Very High | First GitHub Actions run (`check`, `site`) | Both green on `main` | B-01 | R-14 |
| B-22 | Very High | Build LINZ's `map` container (`topographic-system/packages/map`) and render one sheet (e.g. BX24) with the **stock** `topographic-qgis` project | Stock PDF/PNG of one sheet committed as baseline | — | R-18 |
| B-23 | Very High | Obtain Topo50 GeoParquet data for that sheet (NZTopo50 QGIS plugin download or the project JSON referenced in `packages/map/README.md`) | Data path documented; render reproducible | — | R-18 |
| B-28 | High | Check AGPL-3.0 (+ font exemption) obligations if we modify or swap Nimbus Sans LINZ | Decision logged | — | R-18, R-06 |
| B-03 | High | Extend `preview/` to show `topo-raster-gridded` side by side; run on live tiles | Raster panes render | — | — |
| B-26 | High | Do served raster tiles include baked relief shading? Only then decide on the client hillshade direction for the raster style | Answer + decision logged | B-03 | R-03 |
| B-15 | High | Headtorch swatch experiment (print the six Topo50 inks + proposed inks) | Photos + measured contrast | — | OQ-08, F-21 |
| B-10 | Low | File Atkinson Next Ō/ō issue/PR (less urgent: QGIS shapes text, F-28) | URL logged | — | OQ-10 |
| B-25 | Very High | QML override: label FontStyle → upright; size floor (≥7 pt default, 6 pt min) | Re-rendered sheet; italic share 0% | B-22, B-23 | R-05, R-09, F-30 |
| B-24 | Very High | QML symbology: index/intermediate contours, closed-track symbol, distinct spring glyphs, forest vs scrub step, no red-orange-only meaning | Print audit pairs pass floors on re-render | B-22, B-23 | R-04, R-11, R-17 |
| B-29 | High | Audit rendered sheets (palette pairs, simulations) and add to site comparisons | Before/after on site | B-24, B-25 | R-14 |
| B-04 | High | Captures of stock vs accessible Topo50 at the 7 scenarios | On the site | B-27 or B-29 | R-16 |
| B-11 | Low | Trial Atkinson Next in the QGIS render (shaping makes Ō/ō work) | Side-by-side + decision | B-25 | R-06, F-28 |
| B-27 | High | Render accessible raster tiles for a region; serve alongside `topo-raster-gridded` | Preview shows both | B-24, B-25 | R-18 |
| B-14 | Low | Greyscale-safe print and high-contrast variants from the QGIS fork | Variants rendered + gated | B-24 | R-13 |
| B-16 | High | Deploy site (GitHub Pages, `SITE_BASE`) | Public URL | B-02 | — |
| B-17 | Very Low | Site dark theme | S1–S3 pass in both schemes | — | — |

| B-20 | Very High | User testing plan + recruitment | Plan doc | B-24, B-25 | R-16 |
| B-21 | Very High | Run sessions; log results | Grade-B findings from our own study | B-20 | R-16 |
| B-05–B-09, B-19 | Very Low | Secondary web-vector track (see board) | — | — | logs 0013–0020 |
